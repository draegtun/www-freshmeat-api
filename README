** IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT **

Circa April 2009 Freshmeat relaunched their site and completely dropped the XML-RPC API :(

In place is a new Freshmeat API 3.0 using REST JSON (or XML).

Its not clear how stable this API is.    I'll look more closely at this in a few months 
time and perform necessary surgery on this module.

So note this module will not work in its present state until I make investigate the new API 
& changes source code changes.

Very sorry about this.
